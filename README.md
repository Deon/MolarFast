MolarFast
=========
<h1>About MolarFast</h1>
MolarFast is designed to give you the Molar Mass of a chemical compound quickly - hence MolarFast. This web-app was developed with AngularJS and Bootstrap for the front-end, with Flask and Python providing the back-end. If you're wondering why there's a time thing on the home page, truth be told ... we don't know either. But then again, it helped us figure out a few implementation issues so we left it.

As of the latest update, MolarFast is mostly functional - you can use brackets, coefficents, etc. However, hydrates DO NOT fully work. 

<h1>About Us</h1>
MolarFast was created at the University of Waterloo's Software Engineering HackDay on November 21, 2014 by Timothy Mui, a Computer Engineering student, and Deon Hua, a Software Engineering student.
