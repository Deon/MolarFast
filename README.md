<h1>About MolarFast</h1>
<p>
MolarFast is designed to give you the Molar Mass of a chemical compound quickly - hence MolarFast.
This web-app was developed with AngularJS and Bootstrap for the front-end, with Flask and Python providing the back-end. As such, MolarFast is functional on all mobile devices. 
</p>
<p>As of the latest update, MolarFast is mostly functional - you can use brackets, coefficents, etc. However, hydrates DO NOT fully work.
