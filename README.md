MolarFast
=========
<h1>About MolarFast</h1>
<p>
	MolarFast is designed to give you the Molar Mass of a chemical compound quickly - hence MolarFast.
As of the latest update, MolarFast is mostly functional - you can use brackets, coefficents, and hydrates.
Currently, nested brackets are not working.
</p>

<p>Most information on constants and other values were obtained from data sheets provided by the
University of Waterloo Department of Chemical Engineering. Standard atomic weight is used for all molar mass calculations. Standard atomic weight values
were obtained from <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Compositions/stand_alone.pl">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a>.
The University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo Department of Chemical Engineering, nor NIST is associated or affiliated with MolarFast.</p>

<p>This web-app was developed with AngularJS, Bootstrap, Flask, JQuery, and Python. As such, MolarFast is functional on all mobile devices. </p>
